## siig_switch
siig_switch is a libusb based driver for the [SIIG CE-KV0411-S1 2-Port DisplayPort KVM Switch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ZT1GQ6).

This is currently just a command line utility, but the code should be easily adaptable to be driven by a GUI frontend. The only configuration tested is with the KVM switch linked above on Linux, but it should theoretically work on other platforms, and other KVM switches may have identical firmware.
